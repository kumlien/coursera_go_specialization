Race conditions.

Race condition is a state where the outcome of some source code is non-deterministic and typically depends on the low level of interleaving done by the os. 

In this example two functions writes the same variable 'raceOn'. Both functions are invoked using the 'go' keyword which makes it possible for the Go runtime to schedule them concurrently. Since there is no control mechanism in place controlling which function actually writes the value first, the result differs between different invocations.
